Below are 10 technical skill areas that typically differentiate electronic trading engineers from more general software developers:

1. Low-Latency Optimization & Performance Tuning

Deep understanding of CPU cache hierarchies, instruction pipelines, and memory management.

Use of lock-free data structures, micro-optimizations, and zero-copy techniques.

Proficiency in profiling (e.g., perf, VTune) to remove bottlenecks.



2. Advanced Concurrency & Parallelism

Hands-on experience with multi-threading, lock-free programming, and hardware-level concurrency.

Knowledge of advanced synchronization primitives and how they affect performance.



3. In-Depth Knowledge of Market Microstructure

Familiarity with exchange order types, tick-to-trade workflows, and matching engines.

Understanding of how liquidity, spreads, and order book dynamics affect trading strategies.



4. Specialized Networking Protocols & Techniques

Proficiency in FIX, FAST, ITCH, OUCH, and other exchange-specific protocols.

Experience with kernel bypass (e.g., DPDK), RDMA, and other ultra-low-latency network stacks.



5. Real-Time Data Processing & Event-Driven Architecture

Building systems that process high-volume data streams in microseconds to milliseconds.

Designing solutions that handle bursts of market data without dropping messages or slowing down.



6. High Availability & Fault Tolerance

Implementing resilient architectures with failover, redundancy, and real-time monitoring.

Ensuring minimal downtime (or zero downtime) in globally distributed trading platforms.



7. Hardware/Software Co-Optimization

Awareness of how specialized hardware (e.g., FPGAs, GPU acceleration) can reduce latency.

Tuning OS parameters (IRQ affinity, CPU pinning) and selecting optimal network topologies.



8. Complex Testing & Release Management

Maintaining robust environments for load testing, latency benchmarking, and simulation.

Managing frequent code deployments while adhering to strict reliability and regulatory needs.



9. Regulatory Compliance & Real-Time Risk Control

Integrating real-time risk checks, pre-trade controls, and post-trade surveillance.

Logging and auditing frameworks to meet stringent regulatory and client requirements.



10. Cross-Functional Domain Expertise



Ability to collaborate closely with quants, traders, and risk managers to translate fast-changing business requirements into technical deliverables.

Depth of knowledge in finance/trading concepts and an understanding of how technology directly impacts P&L.
